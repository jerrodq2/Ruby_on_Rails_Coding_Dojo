# Ruby_on_Rails_Coding_Dojo
A collection of my practice, assignments, and projects from Coding Dojo with plain Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This repository was made to gather/organize all my Ruby related work, since it was originally in a shared class repo. I've also added comments to several projects and added several word docs in order to cover the basics, further my understanding, and to serve as a refresher in case i'm ever rusty.
